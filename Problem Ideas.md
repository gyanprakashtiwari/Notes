# Modular Arithmetic
- a mod b = a if a < b
- (a+b) mod m = ((a mod m) + (b mod m)) mod m


# Searching and Sorting

- permutation of n is an array of n numbers >= 1 and each number occurs exactly once
- lower_bound --> pointer to first number >= target
- upper_bound --> pointer to first number > target

# GCD
`GCD(a1, a2, a3, … , an)=GCD(a1, a1+a2, a1+a2+a3, …, a1+a2+a3+…+an)`
